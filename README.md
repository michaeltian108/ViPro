# Adversarial Video Promotion Attacks Against Text-to-Video Retrieval
We propose the first targeted attacks against Text-to-Video Retrieval (T2VR) to expose an overlooked vulnerability that may be abused for financial gain and widespread (mis)information. See our work at [arxiv].


# **TL;DR;**
ℹ️ This is our project with access to:
1. 📚Mainstream Text-to-Video Retrieval (T2VR) datasets (MSR-VTT, ActivityNet, DiDeMo);
2. 💻Finetuning SOTA models (Cap4Video, DRL).
3. 👿Attacking models with Co-Attack, SGA, and ViPro(ours) under **White-box**, **Grey-box** and **Black-box** settings.
4. 🚀Evaluations under defenses including JPEG and Temporal shuffling.

We will release our data/checkpoints for reproducibility of the T2VR community. 
Full code will be released after acceptance.
Details for Updates&Code coming soon...
